# BUMBLEBEE - English to French AI Translator

As a college student, I learned quite a bit regarding AI/ML including how the actual mathematics of complex algorithms works. However, transformers were not one of those models. The purpose of this project is to help me learn how the transformer architecture works. The end goal is for me to create my own modern AI models from scratch and the best way I learn is by teaching.
